# Stopwatch
Chronometer(count up timer) just for simple use

The first small project "for yourself" on kotlin. 
There is no state saving when changing the configuration. 
Horizontal orientation is strictly specified, without the possibility of changing to vertical. 
There are 3 buttons: start, pause, reset. Each of which is responsible for its own functionality.
Used the built-in Chronometer class
