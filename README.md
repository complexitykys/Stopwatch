# Stopwatch
Chronometer(count up timer) just for simple use

The first small project "for myself" on kotlin.
When changing the configuration, the state is saved (fixed, it was not saved before).
The orientation is free: vertical, horizontal, the configuration is saved.
There are 3 buttons: start, pause, reset. Each of them is responsible for its own functionality.
ViewModel, LiveData, SavedStateHandle are used.
Pleasant use
