# Stopwatch
Chronometer(count up timer) just for simple use

The first small project "for myself" on kotlin.
When changing the configuration, the state is saved (fixed, it was not saved before).
The orientation is free: vertical, horizontal, the configuration is saved.
There are 3 buttons: start, pause, reset. Each of them is responsible for its own functionality.
ViewModel, LiveData, SavedStateHandle are used.
Pleasant use

     /* p.s.
                * Of course we can make a reveal circular animation to change the theme,
                * but is it necessary in such an application? :) 
                * after all, 100 or more lines of code is quite a lot.. */
